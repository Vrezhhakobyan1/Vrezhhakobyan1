## I am a Software QA Engineer.

## About me
I am very confident about the knowledge I have and I treat work responsiblyâ€¤ I do my tasks
on time and I have great interests to develop in the field of testing. I think automation is
important in testing. I have started learning Java and I already have basic knowledge. I'm
sure that soon I'll be able to write autotests. I worked as a Presenter(tester), where I tested
products and projects prior to their presentation. I can switch from one programming
language to another.
